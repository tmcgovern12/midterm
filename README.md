 Midterm Exam Starter Code

 Fork and Clone this repository for your own purposes. 

 Follow the steps carefully. 

 All coding will be done in index.html. Do NOT create a css file. Put all your css between the style tags that I have provided in the head section of index.html.

 When you finish, save your work and submit index.html to the final question of the midterm in Canvas.
